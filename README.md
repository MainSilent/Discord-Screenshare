## Discord ScreenShare Bot

ðŸ”´ This is the main repository and it is visible in commits, I made it private by accident, This is why this repo has less star and fork compared to other identical repositories.

It's headless and there is no need for GUI.

Please make sure you have `youtube_dl` and `chromedriver` installed.

Note: This bot currently doesn't work on Windows
